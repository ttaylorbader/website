<p>Tamia was raised in Richmond, VA and attended private schools in the Richmond area from Pre-K through College. It was during these years that Tamia became an avid reader and computer tinkerer. After earning her Bachelor of Arts in History from Randolph-Macon College, Tamia took a year before beginning graduate school to teach English in La Palma del Condado, Huelva, España. Tamia’s journey began again in August of 2011 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to study Library Science. After graduating in May of 2013, finding a full time Library job was difficult but a job at the Microsoft Store in Durham, NC awakened a skill in her that was unexpected. Tamia’s Library School studies focused on Archives and Records Management but the Microsoft Store showed Tamia that she had a gift and passion for teaching people how to use computers, software, and more. Teaching computer skills at the Microsoft Store for a year and job opening in February of 2015 changed Tamia’s career path. Currently, Tamia is a Library Specialist for the University of Kansas Libraries and is persuing a second master's degree in Database Administration and Design from the University of Denver.</p>

<p>Tamia is a Certified Public Librarian by the State Library of North Carolina and a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta Fraternity, the Kansas Library Association, and the American Library Association.</p>
